# bCsF-Natio

This repository is for the resources of Block Crypto Shortlink & Faucet (bCsF'n). It receives all reports for new filters or existing filters that cause web page breakage. Any contributors are welcome. Contributors who are proven valuable will get write permissions to the repository.

The rationale for including a specific filter in bCsF'n filter lists is the same as the EasyList/EasyPrivacy policies and also takes into account whether a filter requires bCsF'n extended filter syntax.

It is preferred to fix filter issues in EasyList. Any filters included in bCsF'n filter lists must use the extended syntax.

The EasyList-compatible fixes for high-traffic websites are added to bCsF'n filters until they become added to EasyList.

uAssets will fix the following exceptions even if they do not require using the extended syntax:

Ad-Reinsertion
Anti-Blocker
Context Menu Blockage
Cut/Copy/Paste Blockage
Popups/Popunders
Website Breakage
Video Ads
Crypto Site Faucet & Shortner
